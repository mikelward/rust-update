# Running the weekly batch as a personal access token, not the default token

## The problem this solves

Same problem `docs/GITHUB_APP.md` solves — see that file for the full
explanation, confirmed live on `mikelward/mesh#531`: a pull request opened
with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` sits at `action_required` on every one of a
consumer's own `on: pull_request` workflows until a human clicks approve,
because `github-actions[bot]` isn't a repository collaborator. A personal
access token fixes it the same way a GitHub App installation does — the
actor becomes a real collaborator (your own account) — with a simpler
one-time setup at the cost of a broader-blast-radius credential and a weekly
PR that reads as authored by you rather than a distinct bot identity.

**This is the currently used path.** `docs/GITHUB_APP.md`'s narrower,
independently-revocable App installation is the better fit once a
repository takes external contributions — see this repository's `TODO.md`
for that reconsideration, not yet needed while every consumer (`root`,
`mesh`) is single-owner.

## One-time setup, per consumer repository

1. **Create a fine-grained personal access token**
   (https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new):
   - **Repository access**: "Only select repositories" → pick exactly the
     repositories this token authors weekly PRs in, not "All repositories" —
     the same narrow-grant reasoning as the App's per-repo install.
   - **Permissions**: Repository permissions → Contents: Read and write,
     Pull requests: Read and write. Nothing else — matches
     `docs/GITHUB_APP.md`'s App exactly, so the two paths are interchangeable
     without touching the workflow's own permission use.
   - **Expiration**: pick the shortest option you're willing to renew on;
     GitHub does not offer a non-expiring fine-grained token. Renewing means
     generating a new token and updating the secret below in every
     repository it covers.
2. **Add one secret to each consumer repository** (Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions → New repository secret): `RUST_UPDATE_PAT` — the
   token value. Named per-hub, matching `docs/GITHUB_APP.md`'s convention,
   even though the same token value can cover a repository that also runs
   `gradle-update`'s `GRADLE_UPDATE_PAT` — each consumer's secrets are
   independent (no account-wide secret store on a personal account), and a
   per-hub name keeps a consumer running both hubs from having to reason
   about which one a shared name belongs to.

## What the consumer's caller workflow passes

`rust-update.yml` accepts this as a `secrets:` block on `workflow_call`. A
consumer opts in by passing it through:

```yaml
jobs:
  update:
    uses: mikelward/rust-update/.github/workflows/rust-update.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      actions: write
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.RUST_UPDATE_PAT }}
    with:
      # ...existing inputs...
```

Optional on the reusable workflow's side, like `app-id`/`app-private-key`: a
consumer that sets none of the three keeps today's `github.token` behavior
and the approval prompt on its first bot-opened pull request. If both a
token and `app-id`/`app-private-key` are supplied, the token wins.

## What changes for you, once wired

Nothing about the weekly batch's shape. GitHub's UI shows your own account
as the actor once it holds the token, which is the one visible difference:
expect the PR author to read as you rather than `github-actions[bot]` after
the switch. Nothing else — commit author, `Co-Authored-By` lines, PR body
content, checks, and the trust model in `README.md` are all unaffected; this
only changes which credential opens the pull request and pushes the branch.
